About
-----
The "php-meter" is a simple solution that uses PHP and Javascript technologies to offer a way to monitor the bandwidth consumption (download/upload) in real time of your internet link, thus allowing you to have an idea of how much traffic is being generated by your network.

-----------
This project was developed and tested in the following environment:
- GNU/Linux 4.18.0-147.5.1.el8_1.x86_64 - CentOS Linux release 8.1.1911 (Core)
- PHP 7.2.11
- lighttpd/1.4.55

Setup
-----
1 - Move this project to the web server's root directory

2 - Edit the file "include/config.inc.php" and make the necessary changes

3 - Set the owner and permissions according to the user who runs the web server daemon:

* Using the user "http" as an example:
chown -R http:http <WEB DIRECTORY>/php-meter/
find <WEB DIRECTORY>/php-meter/ -type d -exec chmod -R 755 {} +
